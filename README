I basically created this project to learn about event-driven programming. It is a command line tool to work with Jabber/Google talk

First setup:
Run registerUser.py
This will write a file user_credentials.txt to disk which will have your username and an encrypted version of your password

To run server:
python ghey.py &


To send messages:
python hey.py <space separated list of receivers>
<message>
Ctrl+D
